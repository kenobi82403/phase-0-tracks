// Release 0 : Find the Longest Phrase

// In algos.js, write a function that takes an array of words or phrases and returns the longest word or phrase in the array. So if we gave your function the array of ["long phrase","longest phrase","longer phrase"], it would return "longest phrase". This is a logical reasoning challenge, so try to reason through this based on what you already know, rather than Googling the fanciest solution or looking up built-in sorting functions. Note that "some string".length will do what you expect in JS.
// Algorithm

// Function takes in Array of words/phrase
//  - a variable to keep track of the index of the longest word with initial value of 0
//  - iterate the whole Array
//  - condition to see if the current word length of the index is larger than maxIndex
//  - if so, then override with the current word length
// Returns a string by referencing the array with the maxIndex variable
