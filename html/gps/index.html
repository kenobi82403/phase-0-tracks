What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful? The purpose of HTML5 is readability and making the tags more semantic(meaningful). I can see all of the new html 5 semantic tags very useful.


What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page? The browser reads the content of the HTML file from top to bottom.


What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?  I learned how to create my own personal snippets. The guide was very helpful in teaching us how to search and read documentations. In addition, the guide explained to us the differences among the different tags.


What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?  In my opinion the challenge was not too hard to understand because of a great guide and pairing partner. The most difficult is probably understanding when to use appropriately use certain tags. I can improve my understanding of html5 and its semantic tags by reading different sources about the subject and also consulting with my peers/teachers.
